# React Native Mobile Programming

Reactice Native is a javascript frameword used for mobile development. It is based on React which uses component rendering for its content. To test the development app in different mobile devices, see the following instructions below.

### Testing for IOS - `npm run ios`

Note that testing for IOS may require a Mac computer because of `XCode`. Option one is buying a macbook. Option two is using `Xamarin` (I don't know how reliable this is YET). Option three is using `Docker` to trick `XCode` (This is uncharted terrority for me right now) [[HERE]](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/gwg3e4/free_release_dockerosx_run_xcode_on_linux_sign/)

### Testing for Android - `npm run android`

For this, you need to install `android studio` [[HERE]](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=Cj0KCQjwkqSlBhDaARIsAFJANkhqEsx9jTrMUKjcRuQKDOMPkHAEEXGt0Tt7cozYD6l_TAUROo-KgdoaAmXnEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
