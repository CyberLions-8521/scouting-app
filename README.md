### React Native Mobile Programming

Reactice Native is a javascript framework used for mobile development. It is based on React which uses component rendering for its content. Instead of using the Document Object Model (DOM) we find on most websites to structure them, we use the native components we would find on IOS and Android. 

To test the development app in different mobile devices, see the following instructions below.
