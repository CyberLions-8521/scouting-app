# React Native Mobile Programming

Reactice Native is a javascript framework used for mobile development. It is based on React which uses component rendering for its content. Instead of using the Document Object Model (DOM) we find on most websites to structure them, we use the native components we would find on IOS and Android. 

To test the development app in different mobile devices, see the following instructions below.

### Testing for IOS - `npm run ios`

Note that testing for IOS may require a Mac computer because of `XCode`. Option one is buying a macbook. Option two is using `Xamarin` (I don't know how reliable this is YET). Option three is using `Docker` to trick `XCode` (This is uncharted terrority for me right now) [[HERE]](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/gwg3e4/free_release_dockerosx_run_xcode_on_linux_sign/)

### Testing for Android - `npm run android`

For this, you need to install `android studio` [[HERE]](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=Cj0KCQjwkqSlBhDaARIsAFJANkhqEsx9jTrMUKjcRuQKDOMPkHAEEXGt0Tt7cozYD6l_TAUROo-KgdoaAmXnEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

Android Studio also uses chocolatey, a command line interface. Another example of a CLI would be npm or yarn.
